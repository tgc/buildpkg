===========
What is it?
===========
buildpkg is a collection of bourne shell script code that implements a
framework for easy scripting a package build for IRIX or Solaris in
a repeatable manner.

Anyone familiar with how an rpm specfile works will see the similarities
but basically it works on the premise that everything is built into a
staging area and metadata describing the final package layout is used to
automatically generate the necessary metadata for the native
packageformat.  By design it is not possible to hand-tweak the generated
metadata as it is always regenerated, any tweaks must be implemented
through metadata in the buildsystem.

Dependencies are automatically extracted from files in the stagedir
(filtering is possible) and it's also possible to manually add hidden
dependencies that cannot be extracted automatically.

There's also steps that automcatically compiles manpages and compresses
them.  It can handle symlinked manpages and even manpages that are just
links to other manpages (ie. using the nroff .so command).

===============
Getting started
===============
There's a few customizations that should be done before begining to
build packages.

 * The environment variable BUILDPKG_SCRIPTS should point to buildpkg
 * The environment variable BUILDPKG_BASE should point to your packages
 * check the value of topinstalldir in buildpkg.functions
 * check the value of pkgprefix in buildpkg.functions and
   buildpkg.packaging.irix
 * check tool paths in buildpkg.tools and override with a
   <hostname>.irix or <hostname>.solaris config file.
 * for building perl modules you must also adjust paths
   in generic_install_perl
